Pokemon game in python

Hello.

DISCLAIMER(s): First off, I don't own Pokemon. Nintendo and Game Freak Does (2015).

I learned python on the job these past 6 months. I am NOT a Python Guru.
Don't be judgemental of some of my methods look like C code, which I am more familiar with C, C++, and C#.

Second, this is just a little program I made just to see if I could. 
I have no intention of publishing this AT ALL. Neither should you.

INTRODUCTION This is just for fun, as Pokemon was a big thing for me growing up.

The Idea of this Program:

The idea is to incorperate all, and I mean ALL, of the pokemon, moves, items, and characters into one game.
I also want to be able to train pokemon and bring them into leagues and stadiums, 
like a mix between Pokemon stadium and the original Anime.

As this is by no means an easy task, I will focus on the Kanto, the original 151 pokemon first, 
implementing Gen VI machanics, or most of them with some of my own improvements. 
Most of the simple moves are complete, with some of the more mechanical moves still being in the works.

Example of improvement, Potion Items now heal Pokemon 20 hp or 20% of their max HP, 
which ever is higher. This way, Potions can still be relivant late game.

Feel Free to offer comments on better methods of coding. I'd like to hear them.
If you want to work on this on your own, go ahead. copy the copy or the files as you will. 
As Nintendo is protective of their franchises, I am not claiming anything.
